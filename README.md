Kotlin Koans
===========

Kotlin Koans are a series of exercises to get you familiar with the Kotlin Syntax. 
Each exercise is created as a failing unit test and your job is to make it pass. 

Open up the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your favorite editor. 
Run 'All tests' and fix them.

#### How to work with Koans using this project

You have 42 tasks to do. 
Each task lives in its function: from `task0` to `task41`.

You regularly have to change the function `taskN` by replacing its body (which starts out as the function invocation `todoTaskN()`), with the correct code according to the problem.
The function `todoTaskN()` throws an exception, so you have to replace that invocation with meaningful code.

Using `documentation` argument you can open the related part of Kotlin online documentation.
Press `F1` (Quick Documentation) on `docN()`, then "See also" section gives you a link.

Using `references` argument you can usually navigate and see the code mentioned in the task description.

The repository has two branches, `master` which contains the exercises for you to do and `resolutions` which contains the resolved exercises. 
Make sure you donâ€™t cheat!
